# Cloud Foundry Domain Broker

Cloud Foundry service broker to manage AWS CloudFront, AWS ALBs and Let's Encrypt.

Like the [cf-domain-broker](https://github.com/18F/cf-domain-broker), this
broker combines the features of the
[cf-cdn-service-broker](https://github.com/18F/cf-cdn-service-broker) and
the [cf-domain-broker-alb](https://github.com/18F/cf-domain-broker-alb). It
provisions Let's Encrypt certificates for a given domain, and configures
either AWS ABLs or an AWS CloudFront distribution to use that certificate.

## AWS GovCloud

It's important to note this broker and it's configuration was designed first
and foremost for AWS GovCloud, which has some limitations when it comes to
global configurations. For example, Route53 is not avaialble in GovCloud as
it's a global service, so while the domain broker can be deployed as a Cloud
Foundry app in GovCloud, it still needs to cross the boundary into the AWS
commercial cloud.

## Usage

When users request a domain service instance, this broker will provision a
Let's Encrypt certificate, an ELB and a CloudFront CDN, and wire them all up
together. It does _not_ attempt to manage DNS (as most users already have DNS
solutions in place).

This requires a manual step to be performed by the user after the instance is
created, as described... here:

### Let's Encrypt Challenge Challenges

We have some constraints that make the [Let's Encrypt Challenge
process](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/) "difficult":

#### `HTTP01`

`HTTP01` with CloudFront gives us a chicken-and-egg problem, in that CloudFront
will not answer to a custom domain, even for HTTP, without [verifying ownership
of that domain via a valid SSL
certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cnames-and-https-requirements.html#https-requirements-certificate-issuer):

> If you want to use an alternate domain name with your CloudFront
> distribution, you must verify to CloudFront that you have authorized rights
> to use the alternate domain name. To do this, you must attach a valid
> certificate to your distribution, and make sure that the certificate comes
> from a trusted CA that is listed on the Mozilla Included CA Certificate List.
> **CloudFront does not allow you to use a self-signed certificate to verify your
> authorized rights to use an alternate domain name.**

#### `TLS-ALPN01`

We still need to fully investigate `ALPN01`, and its support in CloudFront.
It's not clear if the `ALPN01` certificate is a self-signed cert - if so, we'll
likely hit the same CloudFront limitation listed above.

Investigation pointers:

- [CloudFront supports HTTP/2](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/09/amazon-cloudfront-now-supports-http2/)
- [ALPN is the required SSL implementation for HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-Layer_Protocol_Negotiation)
- [Dehydrate](https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated/blob/master/docs/tls-alpn.md) bash ACME client can generate ALPN certs.

#### `DNS01`

We do not have access to or control over DNS for the application, so we cannot
automate the `DNS01` challenge.

#### Our Solution - Manual DNS Updates

Because of these limitations, we return instructions to the end user as to how
to configure their DNS `TXT` record. We then monitor DNS for the record to be
set and propagated globally before continuing with the `DNS01` challenge
verification.

> **Tip**: These map directly to the keys in [`RuntimeSettings`](/types/broker.go).

### `RESOLVERS`

The internal ACME client leverages a custom DNS resolver pre-check. This means
the internal ACME client will try to resolve `TXT` records from DNS01 challenges
before informing the upstream ACME server the record is ready to be resolved.

As part of that, if no resolvers are set, no DNS01 records will be able to be
created as nothing will resolve (and the broker will likely crash).

The resolvers (can be more than one) must be in the following format per resolver:
`{Name}={IP}:{Port}`. For example:

```bash
RESOLVERS="level3=4.2.2.2:53,google=8.8.8.8:53,internal=192.168.0.2:53"
```

## IAM Policies

As this broker manages ELBs, IAM Certificates, CloudFront and other
AWS resources, it requires an IAM policy that allows access to those APIs.
We've [provided a sample policy](/doc/sample_iam_policy.json), but you're
responsible for auditing your own security policies. No warranty, etc, etc.

## Pipeline Configuration

This broker leverages [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org) for it's deployment
automation, but it's not dependent on it. You can find example and live
concourse configuration files in [the `ci/` directory](/ci).

## History

This broker supersedes the
[cf-domain-broker](https://github.com/18F/cf-domain-broker), the
[cf-cdn-service-broker](https://github.com/18F/cf-cdn-service-broker) and
the [cf-domain-broker-alb](https://github.com/18F/cf-domain-broker-alb).
The rationale for re-writing the
[cf-domain-broker](https://github.com/18F/cf-domain-broker) is recorded
[here](docs/rewrite.md).

### Why rewrite the [cf-domain-broker](https://github.com/18F/cf-domain-broker)?

The ACMEv1 deprecation deadline is currently looming, and the
[cf-domain-broker](https://github.com/18F/cf-domain-broker) is half-completed.
Our team is much stronger in Python than in Go, and this broker is not in a
performance-sensitive path, nor does it benefit from Go's phenomenal static
compilation feature. In addition, the Go [lego
library](https://github.com/go-acme/lego) is ill-suited for the asynchronous
and manual workflow this broker must provide.

After some discussion, it was agreed that we could move faster and be in a
better maintenance position by
